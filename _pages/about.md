I'm a PhD student at the <a href="https://www.cam.cornell.edu/cam">Center for Applied Math of Cornell University</a>, where I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.danielrkowal.com/">Daniel Kowal</a>. 

I'm broadly interested in Bayesian Statistics, particularly non-parametric regression, forecasting, and factor analysis. 

Previously, I have done research in statistical phylogenetics and algebraic combinatorics.
